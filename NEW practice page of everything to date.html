            <p>
                James Tiberius Kirk was born in Riverside, Iowa, on March 22, 2233, where he was raised by his
                parents, George and Winona Kirk. Although born on Earth, Kirk lived for a time on Tarsus IV, where he
                was one of nine surviving witnesses to the massacre of 4,000 colonists by Kodos the Executioner. James
                Kirk's brother, George Samuel Kirk, is first mentioned in "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" and
                introduced and killed in "Operation -- Annihilate!", leaving behind three children.
            <p>

                Kirk became the first and only student at Starfleet Academy to defeat the Kobayashi Maru test, garnering
                a commendation for original thinking after he reprogrammed the computer to make the "no-win scenario"
                winnable. Kirk was granted a field commission as an ensign and posted to advanced training aboard the
                USS Republic. He was then promoted to lieutenant junior grade and returned to Starfleet Academy as a
                student instructor. According to a friend, students could either "think or sink" in his class, and
                Kirk himself was "a stack of books with legs". Upon graduating in the top five percent, Kirk was
                promoted to lieutenant and served aboard the USS Farragut. While assigned to the Farragut, Kirk
                commanded his first planetary survey and survived a deadly attack by a bizarre cloud-like creature that
                killed a large portion of the Farragut's crew, including his commanding officer, Captain Garrovick.
                Although the surviving Executive Officer disagreed, Kirk blamed himself for years for hesitating to fire
                his assigned weapons upon seeing the threat until a later encounter with the creature showed that firing
                immediately with conventional weapons would have been useless anyway.

                Kirk became Starfleet's youngest starship captain after receiving command of the USS Enterprise for a
                five-year mission, three years of which are depicted in the original Star Trek series. Kirk's most
                significant relationships in the television series are with first officer Spock and chief medical
                officer Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy. McCoy is someone to whom Kirk unburdens himself and is a foil to
                Spock. Robert Jewett and John Shelton Lawrence's The Myth of the American Superhero describes Kirk as
                "a hard-driving leader who pushes himself and his crew beyond human limits". Terry J. Erdman and
                Paula M. Block, in their Star Trek 101 primer, note that while "cunning, courageous and confident", Kirk
                also has a "tendency to ignore Starfleet regulations when he feels the end justifies the means"; he is
                "the quintessential officer, a man among men and a hero for the ages". Although Kirk throughout the
                series becomes romantically involved with various women, when confronted with a choice between a woman
                and the Enterprise, "his ship always won".

                Roddenberry wrote in a production memo that Kirk is not afraid of being fallible, but rather is afraid
                of the consequences to his ship and crew should he make an error in judgment. Roddenberry wrote:

                [Kirk] has any normal man's insecurities and doubts, but he knows he cannot ever show them—except
                occasionally in private with ship's surgeon McCoy or in subsequent moments with Mr. Spock whose opinions
                Kirk has learned to value so highly.[
            </p>

                In Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Admiral Kirk is Chief of Starfleet Operations, and he takes command of
                the Enterprise from Captain Willard Decker. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's novelization of The
                Motion Picture depicts Kirk married to a Starfleet officer killed during a transporter accident.
                At the beginning of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Kirk takes command of the Enterprise from Captain
                Spock to pursue his enemy from "Space Seed", Khan Noonien Singh. The movie introduces Kirk's former
                lover Carol and his son, David Marcus. Spock, who notes that "commanding a starship is [Kirk's] first,
                best destiny", dies at the end of Star Trek II. In Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Admiral Kirk
                leads his surviving officers in a successful mission to rescue Spock from a planet on which he is
                reborn. Although Kirk is demoted to Captain in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home for disobeying Starfleet
                orders, he also receives command of a new Enterprise, the USS Enterprise-A (NCC 1701-A). The ship is
                ordered decommissioned at the end of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.

                In Star Trek Generations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard finds Kirk living in the timeless Nexus, despite the
                fact that history recorded his death during the Enterprise-B's maiden voyage, Kirk having fallen into
                the Nexus in the incident that caused his "death". Picard persuades Kirk to return to Picard's present
                to help stop the villain Soran from destroying Veridian III's sun. Although Kirk initially refuses the
                offer, he agrees after realizing the Nexus cannot give him the one thing he has always sought: the
                ability to make a difference. The two leave the Nexus and stop Soran. However, Kirk is mortally wounded;
                as he dies, Picard assures him that he helped to "make a difference". Picard buries Kirk on the planet,
                however in Star Trek: Picard's third season (2023), Kirk’s body is revealed to be stored in stasis at
                the Daystrom Institute by Section 31.

                Spock was one of the first Vulcan cadets at Starfleet Academy. During his time there, Spock had Onafuwa
                for Fundamentals of Quantum Stochastics and several other advanced courses. He was commissioned as a
                Starfleet officer in 2250 with the serial number S 179-276 SP and held an A7 computer expert
                classification. Later in life, he wrote a memoir about the challenges he faced at Starfleet Academy,
                titled The Many and the One. (PIC: "The Star Gazer"; ST: "Q&A"; TOS: "The Enterprise Incident", "Court
                Martial", "The Ultimate Computer")
